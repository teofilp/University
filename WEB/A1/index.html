          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            Formula One (also known as <b>Formula 1</b> or <b>F1</b>) is the
            highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater
            formula racing cars sanctioned by the Federation Internationale de
            l'Automobile (FIA). The World Drivers' Championship, which became
            the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the
            premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season
            in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to
            which all participants' cars must conform.[1] A Formula One season
            consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take
            place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public
            roads.

              "In my personal opinion, I woke up to this morning's news,
              shocked, so I don't know." Vettel said at a press conference
              during pre-season testing.. "I think it's horrible to see what is
              happening. Obviously if you look at the calendar we have a race
              scheduled in Russia. For myself, my own opinion is I should not
              go, I will not go. I think it's wrong to race in the
              country."</cite
